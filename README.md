#Lex
###Monadic Parser Combinators for Javascript

Lex is a library very similar to the outstanding [Parsec package](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/parsec) for Haskell.
Lex doesn't match all functionality or speed, of Parsec, nor does it attempt to. Lex makes it easy to write clean, readable,
parsers for a wide variety of applications.
